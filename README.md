In Defense Of Encrypting Password Hashes

I created this demo for the purposes of demonstrating why one would want to encrypt their password hashes.

`pip install argon2-cffi`
then, if you want to create your own set of random hashes using recommended parameters:
`python3 setup.py`
and then:
`python3 crack.py`
